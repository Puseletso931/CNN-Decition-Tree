# Project Overview

This project implements a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Decision Tree (DT) model for image classification. It combines the CNN’s robust feature extraction capabilities with the interpretability of DTs, allowing users to examine how model transparency can be achieved with minimal accuracy trade-offs. The project includes code to train and evaluate individual CNN and DT models, generate synthetic data, and integrate them into the hybrid CNN-DT model.

# Project Setup

## Step 1: Install Requirements
To install all required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Step 2: Graphviz Setup (Windows Users)

For Windows users, Graphviz may require additional setup:

### 1. Install Graphviz
Download the Graphviz installer from the [Graphviz download page](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/).

### 2. Set the Graphviz Path
After installation, add Graphviz's `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows `pydotplus` to locate Graphviz.

- Open **Environment Variables** settings.
- Edit the `PATH` variable to include the path to your Graphviz `bin` directory, usually:
  ```plaintext
  C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin
   ```
